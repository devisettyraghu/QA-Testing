  <Why>
    <rawData>The main objective for most of our customers is to gain control over cost, quality, and turn-around time. Our customers seek to reduce a lack of consistency across languages, markets and programs, a lack of cost control over the same, and significant delays in launching global initiatives. </rawData>
  </Why>
  <Why>
    <rawData>While most global organizations have gone through a translation lifecycle – from total centralization to total decentralization and back to the idea that centralization provides the highest benefits – there is a desire to find a middle ground where some functions of the localization process must be centralized while others can take place at the regional or local level. This distributed model allows for great benefits – lower costs, faster turn-around, and greater consistency – while allowing local parties and the central location (HQ) to retain a level of ownership and participation.</rawData>
  </Why>
  <Why>
    <rawData>Obtaining the buy-in from local parties, who often suffer from the “not invented here” syndrome, represents another challenge. Typically, we have found that clear definition of roles and responsibilities, direct lines of communication between our language teams and local parties, and their active participation in parts of the process helps customers overcome this challenge.
Last but not least, is the financial challenge which companies face as they seek to centralize the translation process. As with the organization, our customers do not want to build an internal infrastructure or implement and support more technology. On the contrary, they are seeking a solution that requires a reasonable upfront investment, and provides a quick ROI.

  <Why>
    <rawData>As an extension of our customers’ organizations, Translations.com takes on the challenge to achieve measurable results from centralization, while supporting global, regional, and local parties. To lower costs, improve turn-around times, and ensure quality, we blend industry expertise, market-ready and proprietary technology, and innovative techniques. We centralize asset reuse, project management, application integration, and knowledge sharing. </rawData>
  </Why>
  <Why>
    <rawData>Customers measure results in many ways and over different periods of time. Our goal is to show quick wins and positive results as soon as possible. This could be an initial global campaign completed on time and on budget or a web marketing initiative launched simultaneously in multiple languages. Our solutions do not require lengthy or complex implementation enabling us to quickly deliver measurable results. </rawData>
  </Why>
  <Why>
    <rawData>On a longer-term basis, we will work with our customers to establish measurable results. These could be to increase customer satisfaction ratings, improve global product launches, widen the support of customers worldwide, or reduce the cost per publication and language.</rawData>
